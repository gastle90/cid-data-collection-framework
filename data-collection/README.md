### Architecture

![Architecture](/.images/architecture-data-collection-detailed.png)

1. [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) rule invokes [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) for every deployed data collection module based on schedule.
2. The Step Function launches a [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function **Account Collector** that assumes **Read Role** in the Management accounts and retrieves linked accounts list via [AWS Organizations API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html).
3. Step Functions launches **Data Collection Lambda** function for each collected Account.
4. Each data collection module Lambda function assumes an [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) role in linked accounts and retrieves respective optimization data via [AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html). Retrieved data is aggregated in an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.
5. Once data is stored in the S3 bucket, Step Functions trigger an [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) crawler which creates or updates the table in the [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/components-overview.html#data-catalog-intro).
6. Collected data is visualized with the [Cloud Intelligence Dashboards](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/cloud-intelligence-dashboards/) using [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) to get optimization recommendations and insights.
